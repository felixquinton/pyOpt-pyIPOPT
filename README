In order to install pyIPOPT in pyOpt, copy the pyIPOPT folder in pyOpt/pyOpt/.,
and the setup.py file in pyOpt/.

Make sure the setup.py file reflects your own local settings.

Once this is done, simply run :
python setup.py install


To make sure everything is running fine, you can run the IPOPTtest.py file.

Have fun.
